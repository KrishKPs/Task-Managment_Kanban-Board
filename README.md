# Task Management Application

This is a feature-rich **Task Management Application** designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks with an intuitive interface. A key feature of the application is the ability to drag and drop tasks between different stages of completion, ensuring smooth workflow management.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Add new tasks quickly with a user-friendly input form.
- **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks when they are no longer needed or relevant.
- **Drag and Drop Interface**: Seamlessly move tasks between different statuses like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed" using a simple drag-and-drop feature.
- **Task Status Management**: Visualize tasks in different stages and manage their progress.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Tasks and their statuses are updated instantly without the need for page refreshes.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive application that works across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
- **Persistent Data**: (Optional) Store tasks in a database (e.g., MongoDB) to persist data between sessions.

## Usage

Once the application is set up and running, you can use it as follows:

1. **Adding Tasks**:
   - At the top of the "To Do" column, there is an input field where you can enter the name of a task you want to create.
   - After entering the task name, click the **"Add Task"** button.
   - The new task will appear in the "To Do" column, indicating that it is not yet started.

2. **Managing Tasks**:
   - Tasks are displayed in three different columns representing their status: **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Completed**.
   - You can drag a task from one column to another as its status changes. 
     - For example, if you begin working on a task, drag it from the **To Do** column to the **In Progress** column.
     - Once a task is completed, drag it to the **Completed** column.
   - The drag-and-drop feature is designed for smooth interaction, allowing you to update the status of tasks easily.

3. **Deleting Tasks**:
   - If a task is no longer needed or has been incorrectly added, you can remove it.
   - Each task has a **"Delete"** button next to it. Clicking this will permanently delete the task from the list.


4. **Persistent Storage** :
   - If the application is connected to a database like MongoDB, your tasks will be saved even when you close the application or refresh the page.
   - All changes (adding, updating, or deleting tasks) are stored in the database, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
   - If a database is not set up, tasks will only remain during the active session and will disappear upon page reload.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - You can use this application on any device, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
   - The layout will adjust automatically to provide an optimal user experience across different screen sizes.

6. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**:
   - To move a task between columns, click and hold on the task, drag it to the desired column, and release the mouse.
   - The task's status will update based on the column you drop it in (e.g., "To Do" â†’ "In Progress").
